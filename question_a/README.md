# Line Overlaps

In this solution, I created 2 classes to manage the Lines and the operation between them.

- `Line`: This class allows us to create a **Line** between two numbers which can be positive or negative. There is a validation that help us to organize the numbers so we can initialize it in any order.

- `Overlap`: Take two instances of Line as arguments to validate if there is an overlap between them.
